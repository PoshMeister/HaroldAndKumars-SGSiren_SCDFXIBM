We are 4 students from NUS Engineering with a passion for learning new things and using this knowledge to help others :)

## **About the Project**
During a casual conversation among friends, we started talking about National Service: a common route for conversations among men in Singapore to take. Two of our friends who happened to be firefighters began telling us about their response routines during a fire. They said that in many instances, traffic is a huge problem when someone calls 995, especially during peak traffic periods. Precious minutes saved in such a situation could prevent victims from crossing over the fine line between life and death. Hence, we sought a way to improve the awareness of motorists towards emergency response vehicles. Our proposed solution utilizes the GPS capability of the new In-Vehicle Unit to alert motorists about an approaching emergency vehicle in advance.
